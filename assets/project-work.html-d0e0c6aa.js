Try to be creative and come up with an application someone wants to use, i.e. an application that solves a real-world problem of some kind. You could for example create an application for an organization you are member of (e.g. a football organization that needs to keep track of members, leaders, teams, training sessions, etc.), or simply an application you would like to use yourself. You can also try asking your family and friends if they need an Android application with some functionality that doesn&#39;t exist today.</p><p>Another way to come up with an application is to think of something you find boring/dangerous/time consuming, and then try to make it fun/safe/avoid it completely by using an Android application. For example, most people find it boring to wait in line. Maybe you can create an application that makes it fun to wait in line? Or an application that entirely eliminates the need to wait in line?</p><h3 id="suggestions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#suggestions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Suggestions</h3><p>At the bottom of this page you find the chapter <em>Project idea: Flee Market Manager</em> that describes a real-world problem you can try to solve by creating an Android application. It can also be used as a guideline for how &quot;complicated&quot;/&quot;complex&quot; the application you create needs to be.</p><p>Another idea is to create an application that can control an embedded system of some kind (dish washer, microwave, robot vacuum cleaner, etc.), for example using Bluetooth. Feel free to create your own embedded system. It can for example be a simple prototype used as a proof of concept. For example, your application might be about controlling a smart lock on a door (a lock that can be locked/unlocked with a smartphone using Bluetooth), but you don&#39;t have any smart lock, so then you create your own embedded system that simulates one, e.g. one that consists of a Bluetooth module and a LED lamp that is turned on/off to indicate if the door is locked or not. <strong>The embedded system can also be simulated as another Android application running on another Android device, e.g. an application showing a red/green circle indicating if the smart lock is locked or not, and this enables you to create a Android application that communicates with any type of embedded system you can think of!</strong></p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>You will not get any credits for doing things not related to the intended learning outcomes in this course.
